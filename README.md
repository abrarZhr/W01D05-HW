# Online Store Part2
you created Online store with HTML and CSS now you will complete your work by adding some javaScript to it to make it more interactive.

Your online store is required to implement the following:
* Within the entirety of your site, you should have the following JavaScript functionality:
    * Create a functional shopping cart for your online store.
    * Allow a “quick add to cart” from the catalogue page.
    * Each product’s page must also have the option to “add to cart”.
    * When an item is added, an alert should tell the user what the current total is.
    * Create a new html page for the cart section which allows the user to see what is in their cart, each item’s price, and the total cost (remember to add VAT!).
    * Create a form which allows for “discount coupons”.
    * Create forms to allow a user to select “collection” or “delivery”.
    * Create forms for different delivery options.
    * Your total should change based on what delivery option is chosen and if a certain coupon is applied.
    * Create a “conﬁrm order” button which alerts the user that their order was successful and generates them a reference number (keyword: generate)
 * Your website should contain:
   * A function which contains hiding/showing.
   * A drop-down menu.
   * Animation effects.
